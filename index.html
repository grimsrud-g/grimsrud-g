            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a first-year PhD student at Stanford University in the Neurosciences Departmental Program. 
                Previously, I conducted undergraduate and post-baccalaureate research at the University of Minnesota, 
                under the mentorship of Dr. Damien Fair. Additionally, I have experience at the intersection of science and 
                translational application of research through work in a Neuroimaging & Neuromodulation based start-up company,
                Turing Medical.

                My research interests lie in three main categories: 1) clinically translational application of neuroimaging in 
                neuropsychiatry and neurodevelopmental disorders; 2) investigating neural mechanisms underlying fMRI signal; and
                3) advancement of fMRI acquisition & analysis methods.

                I am passionate about making science both accessible and engaging for youth, particularily science surrounding mental
                health and wellness. I intend to expand upon my experience in youth outreach gained through Mayo Clinic's InSciEd Out
                Program during my time at Stanford University & beyond.
